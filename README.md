This is my very cool, very wow attempt at creating a landing page following the Odin project.
I will use Flex // flexbox to control the layout the page and get a structure that scales with window size.
Hopefully parents will be proud of me and I can create website to sell very nice pictures of girlfriend, not real yet, feet for big profit.
Engineers don't read README's and dear god I hope my future employer won't because this is where I type when I get a bit bored.

//// Structure ////
I will structure the site much like The Odin Project suggests the structure - meaning it is made in sections and is like a landing page with some images, buttons and links but without too much text or information. Just a nice pleasing landing page that doesn't look like brutalist russian apartment design. Nice.

-- Header # Containing logo and some navigation links
-- Header-banner # A welcome message with a button and an image to captivate the audience... what audience lmao
-- Image-tiles # Some image tiles with a little text under to showcase a bit more about something
-- Inspiring-quote # an inspiring quote although knowing myself it'll be extremely stupid
-- Sign-up-tile # now the audience made it this far, a sign up banner with a sign up button to snatch up those microtransactions yummi.
-- Footer # a footer with the author name, dear god I'm not putting my name to this project
